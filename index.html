<h2>President Declares State Of Emergency After Typhoon Kalmaegi Death Toll Passess 100</h2>
<font color=black>President Feridinand Marcos jr has declared a state of emergency after typhoon Kalmaegi left at least 114 people dead and nearly 130 are still missing in central provinces in the deadliest natural disaster to hit the country this year. Marco's state of national calamity declaration made a meeting with disaster response officials to assess the typhoon's aftermath on Thursday, would allow the government to disburse emergency funds faster and prevent hoarding and overpricing.<br>
Kalmaegi set off flashfloods and caused the river and waterways to swell and the problem has been made worse by the years of quarrying that caused nearby rivers to clog and overflow as well as substandard flood control projects in Cebu province. <br><br><br>

<font color=black>MANILA — The Department of the Interior and Local Government has directed all local chief executives to suspend foreign travel and to stay in their respective jurisdictions to lead disaster preparedness and response efforts as typhoon Uwan enters the Philippine Area of Responsibility.<br>

Local Government Secretary Jonvic Remulla issued the order on Saturday, emphasizing the need for “full leadership presence” in all provinces, cities, municipalities, and barangays while the country braces for the effects of the typhoon.<br>

The directive comes after President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. placed the country under a state of national calamity, following forecasts that Typhoon Uwan could bring heavy rains, strong winds, and possible flooding and landslides in several regions.<br>
Authorities continue to urge the public to stay alert, monitor official advisories, and cooperate with local authorities as the nation braces for the impact of the storm.<br>
